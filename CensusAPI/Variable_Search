#To view available variables, you can use the load_variables() function. Here is an example:
#You can also See Excel File "ACS52021_Table_Codes" in this Folder for Filtering and Viewing ACS5 2021 Variables and Group Codes. 
#You can use this as a framework for organizing future dataset variables, or to advance your search in the ACS5 2021 datasets.


# Install and load the tidycensus package
install.packages("tidycensus")
library(tidycensus)

# Set your census API key
census_api_key("your_api_key_here", install = TRUE, overwrite = TRUE)

# Load available variables for the 2019 ACS 5-year estimates
variables <- load_variables(2019, "acs5", cache = TRUE)

# Print variables
print(variables)


#If you want to search by Geography, you can try out the following
#Here's how you can retrieve the data for all counties using the get_acs() function:

# Set your census API key
census_api_key("your_api_key_here", install = TRUE, overwrite = TRUE)

# Get ACS data for all counties
data <- get_acs(geography = "county", variables = "B19013_001", year = 2019, survey = "acs5")

# Print the data
print(data

#In this script:
#get_acs(geography = "county", variables = "B19013_001", year = 2019, survey = "acs5") 
#retrieves ACS data for all counties. The variables parameter specifies which variables to retrieve
#(in this case, "B19013_001"). print(data) prints the retrieved data.

#Remember to replace "your_api_key_here" with your actual API key. After running this script, 
#data will contain a tibble (a type of data frame used in the tidyverse) of the requested ACS data for all counties.

#If "B19013_001" is not available at the county level, get_acs() will return an error. 
#You can replace "B19013_001" with the variable you're interested in.


#If you're looking for specific variables within the variables table you obtained using load_variables(), 
#you can use the dplyr package's filter() function to subset the table based on your criteria.

#For example, let's assume you are interested in variables related to income:

install.packages(c("tidycensus", "dplyr"))
library(tidycensus)
library(dplyr)

# Set your census API key
census_api_key("your_api_key_here", install = TRUE, overwrite = TRUE)

# Load available variables for the 2019 ACS 5-year estimates
variables <- load_variables(2019, "acs5", cache = TRUE)

# Filter for variables related to income
income_variables <- variables %>%
  filter(grepl("income", label, ignore.case = TRUE))

# Print income-related variables
print(income_variables)
