Metadata Text Analysis of Manuscripts
#Keyword Text Analysis of Microplastic Scholarly Papers#



The Common Practice/Methods for MP Research Include: 
Moore Inst. Open Data Portal + Scholarly Works (Domain Expertise)

1. Sample device and deployment methods (type and size of sample device used and how it was deployed)
2. Number of Samples Collected Total
3. Digestion (type of digestion used in preprocessing, if any)
4. Filtration (what type of filtration used)
5. Filter Size (size or sizes of filter(s))
6. Density Separation (method used for density separation)
7. Microplastic Identification Method (type(s) of identification used, e.g. visual, flourescent, SEM (scanning electron microscoscopy), light microscopy)
8. Spectral Analysis (type of spectral analysis used in study, if any, e.g. GC/MS, FTIR, Raman)
9. Controls (type of controls used, if applicable)


These Methods were scraped as a metadata dataset from relevant manuscripts for comprehending the overall contents of our research and microplastic data

To filter and assess the quality and the current level of standardization between Microplastic Research Data, we employed a Keyword Text Analysis over PDFs using R. Keywords were scraped from Metadata Dataset.
